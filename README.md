# 3D Paddle Play
A prototype of a pseudo-pixel paddle ball game made in Unity URP.

*_Above is the current prototype._ 

*_This alpha build will be further developed and constructed for other features._

## Current Features
- Paddle ball gameplay loop and score system
- Enhanced lighting and visuals via color intensity shaders and particle systems
- Camera shake effects using springed jostling and pushing techniques

### February 2024 Note:
I implemented a very bare bones pixel camera for the game. I plan to try testing this prototype out for more features as I go on.
